# mtcq personal webpage

This is the personal website of Marco TÃºlio Quintino, [https://mtcq.github.io/](https://mtcq.github.io/).


This website was designed using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a beautiful, simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics. 

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.

## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).

### Installation

#### Local setup

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
