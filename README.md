# mtcq personal webpage

This is the personal website of Marco TÃºlio Quintino, [https://mtcq.github.io/](https://mtcq.github.io/).


This website was designed using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a beautiful, simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics. 

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
