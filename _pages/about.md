I’m Marco Túlio Quintino, a researcher in quantum information science who is currently based at [IQOQI Vienna](https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/people/staff/marco-tulio-coelho-quintino) and the University of Vienna in the group of [Časlav Brukner](https://www.quantumfoundations.org/people.html) with an [ESQ postdoc fellowship](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/esq/home/esq-postdocs/postdoc-application/current-esq-postdocs/quintino-marco-tulio). 

My main research interests are higher-order quantum operations, designing quantum circuits to transform operations, causality in quantum theory, quantum discrimination tasks, Bell nonlocality, nonlocal games, and quantum foundations.


All my scientific papers are available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/quintino_m_1.html) and some statistics involving them can be found at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9S-Jrs4AAAAJ&hl). 

I use <a href="https://github.com/mtcq">GitHub</a> to share relevant computational code I develop for my research.
