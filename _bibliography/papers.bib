   abstract = {We present an instance of a task of minimum-error discrimination of two qubit-qubit quantum channels for which a sequential strategy outperforms any parallel strategy. We then establish two new classes of strategies for channel discrimination that involve indefinite causal order and show that there exists a strict hierarchy among the performance of all four strategies. Our proof technique employs a general method of computer-assisted proofs. We also provide a systematic method for finding pairs of channels that showcase this phenomenon, demonstrating that the hierarchy between the strategies is not exclusive to our main example. },

   abstract ={Repeat-until-success strategy is a standard method to obtain success with a probability which grows exponentially in the number of iterations. However, since quantum systems are disturbed after a quantum measurement, it is not straightforward how to perform repeat-until-success strategies in certain quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new structure for probabilistic higher-order transformation named success-or-draw, which allows a repeat-until-success implementation. For that we provide a universal construction of success-or-draw structure which works for any probabilistic higher-order transformation on unitary operations. We then present a semidefinite programming approach to obtain optimal success-or-draw protocols and analyze in detail the problem of inverting a general unitary operation. },

   abstract = {Guided by the intuition of coherent superposition of causal relations, recent works presented quantum processes without classical common-cause and direct-cause explanation, that is, processes which cannot be written as probabilistic mixtures of quantum common-cause and quantum direct-cause relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a quantum process to fail to admit a CCDC explanation and present "simple" processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones against general noise. These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled state and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit coherent mixture of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility of a process to have both relations simultaneously. We then prove that, although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite separable operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not direct-cause. This shows that the problem of deciding weather a process is direct-cause process is not equivalent to entanglement certification and points out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect non-classical CCDC processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical CCDC process. Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that the simple processes presented here are likely to be also the maximally robust against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence between bipartite direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without quantum memory.},

We develop an algorithm for transforming an arbitrary Bell inequality into an equivalent nonlocal game with the largest possible gap, and show its results for the CGLMP and Inn22 inequalities. We present explicit examples of Bell inequalities with gap arbitrarily close to one, and show that this makes it possible to reject local hidden variables with arbitrarily small p-value in a single shot, without needing to collect statistics. We also develop an algorithm for calculating local bounds of general Bell inequalities which is significantly faster than the naïve approach, which may be of independent interest.}

   abstract={ Similarly to quantum states, quantum operations can also be transformed by means of quantum superchannels, also known as process matrices. Quantum superchannels with multiple slots are deterministic transformations whichtake independent quantum operations as inputs. While they are enforced to respect the laws of quantum mechanics, the use of input operations may lack a definite causal order, and characterizations of general superchannels in terms of quantum objects with a physical implementation have been missing. In this paper, we provide a mathematical characterization for pure superchannels with two slots (also known as bipartite pure processes), which are superchannels preserving the reversibility of quantum operations. We show that the reversibility preserving condition restricts all pure superchannels with two slots to be either a quantum circuit only consisting of unitary operations or a coherent superposition of two unitary quantum circuits where the two input operations are differently ordered. The latter may be seen as a generalization of the quantum switch, allowing a physical interpretation for pure two-slot superchannels. An immediate corollary is that purifiable bipartite processes cannot violate device-independent causal inequalities.}

Three classes of protocols are considered, parallel circuits, where the input-operations can be simultaneously, adaptive circuits, where sequential uses of the input-operations are allowed, and general protocols, where the use of the input-operations may be performed without a definite causal order. For these three classes, we develop a systematic semidefinite programming approach that finds a circuit which obtains the desired transformation with the maximal success probability. We then analyse in detail three particular transformations; unitary transposition, unitary complex conjugation, and unitary inversion. For unitary transposition and unitary inverse, we prove that for any fixed dimension d, adaptive circuits have an exponential improvement in terms of uses k when compared to parallel ones. For unitary complex conjugation and unitary inversion we prove that if the number of uses k is strictly smaller than d−1, the probability of success is necessarily zero. We also discuss the advantage of indefinite causal order protocols over causal ones and introduce the concept of delayed input-state quantum circuits.}

The protocol employs an adaptive strategy, proven necessary for the exponential performance. It requires k≥d−1, proven necessary for exact implementation of U^(−1)_d with quantum circuits. Moreover, even when quantum circuits with indefinite causal order are allowed, k≥d−1 uses are required. We then present a finite set of linear and positive semidefinite constraints characterizing universal unitary inversion protocols and formulate a convex optimization problem whose solution is the maximum success probability for given k and d. The optimal values are computed using semidefinite programming solvers for k≤3 when d=2 and k≤2 for d=3.

Among other applications, incompatibility allows for contextuality and Bell nonlocality. This makes of crucial importance developing tools for certifying whether a set of measurements posses a certain structure of incompatibility. Here we show that, for quantum or nonsignaling models, if the measurements employed in a Bell test satisfy a given type of compatibility, then the amount of violation of some specific Bell inequalities become limited. Then, we show that correlations arising from local measurements on two-qubit states violate these limits, which rules out in a device-independent way such structures of incompatibility. In particular, we prove that quantum correlations allow for a device-independent demonstration of genuine triplewise incompatibility. Finally, we translate these results into a semi-device-independent Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-steering scenario.}

A distributed-sampling task naturally arises in such scenario, whose goal is for Alice and Bob to reproduce the statistics of his measurements on her quantum inputs using a fixed communication channel. Their performance at such task can certify quantum communication (QC), and this is formalised by measurement-device-independent QC witnesses. Furthermore, we prove that QC can provide an advantage (over classical communication) for distributed sampling if and only if Bob's measurements are incompatible. This gives an operational interpretation to the fundamental notion of measurement incompatibility, and motivates a generalised notion of it. Our findings have both fundamental and applied implications.}

  abstract = {When transforming pairs of independent quantum operations according to the fundamental rules of quantum theory, an intriguing phenomenon emerges: some such higher-order operations may act on the input operations in an indefinite causal order. Recently, the formalism of process matrices has been developed to investigate these noncausal properties of higher-order operations. This formalism predicts, in principle, statistics that ensure indefinite causal order even in a device-independent scenario, where the involved operations are not characterised. Nevertheless, all physical implementations of process matrices proposed so far require full characterisation of the involved operations in order to certify such phenomena. Here we consider a semi-device-independent scenario, which does not require all operations to be characterised. We introduce a framework for certifying noncausal properties of process matrices in this intermediate regime and use it to analyse the quantum switch, a well-known higher-order operation, to show that, although it can only lead to causal statistics in a device-independent scenario, it can exhibit noncausal properties in semi-device-independent scenarios. This proves that the quantum switch generates stronger noncausal correlations than it was previously known.}

Positive but not completely positive maps such as the transposition map cannot be implemented due to the existence of entanglement in composite quantum systems, but there are classes of states for which the positivity is guaranteed, e.g., states not correlated to other systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of N-copy extension of maps to quantitatively analyze the difference between positive maps and completely positive maps. We consider implementations of the action of positive but not completely positive maps on uncorrelated states by allowing an extra resource of consuming multiple copies of the input state and characterize the positive maps in terms of implementability with multiple copies. We show that by consuming multiple copies, the set of implementable positive maps becomes larger, and almost all positive maps are implementable with finite copies of an input state. The number of copies of the input state required to implement a positive map quantifies the degree by which a positive map violates complete positivity. We then analyze the optimal N-copy implementability of a noisy version of the transposition map.}

To do this, we develop a recently derived bound on the quantum value of linear games based on the norms of game matrices to give a simple sufficient condition to identify linear games with no quantum advantage. Additionally we show how this bound can be extended to the general class of unique games, illustrating it for the case of three outcomes. We then show as a main result that the paradigmatic examples of correlation Bell inequalities with no quantum violation, namely the non-local computation games do not constitute tight Bell inequalities, not even for the correlation polytope. We also extend this to an arbitrary prime number of outcomes for a specific class of these games. We then study the faces in the simplest CHSH Bell scenario of binary dichotomic measurements, and identify edges in the set of quantum correlations in this scenario.
Finally, we relate the non-contextual polytope of single-party correlation inequalities with the cut polytope CUT(∇G), where G denotes the compatibility graph of observables in the contextuality scenario and ∇G denotes the suspension graph of G. We observe that there exist tight non-contextuality inequalities with no quantum violation, and furthermore that this set of inequalities is beyond those implied by the Consistent Exclusivity principle.}

   abstract = {Constructing local hidden variable (LHV) models for entangled quantum states is challenging, as the model should reproduce quantum predictions for all possible local measurements. Here we present a simple method for building LHV models, applicable to general entangled states, which consists in verifying that the statistics resulting from a finite set of measurements is local, a much simpler problem. This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit, fully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods are developed for constructing local hidden state models. We illustrate the practical relevance of these methods with several examples, and discuss further applications.}

We present a simple criterion, applicable to any two-qubit state, which guarantees that the state admits a local hidden state model for arbitrary projective measurements. We find new classes of unsteerable entangled states, which can thus not violate any steering or Bell inequality. In turn, this leads to sufficient conditions for a state to be only one-way steerable, and provides the simplest possible example of one-way steering.

Hence there exist entangled states, the nonlocality of which can be revealed only by using a sequence of measurements. Finally, we show that genuine hidden nonlocality can be maximal.

Recent studies have suggested that the use of atom-photon entanglement can lead to Bell inequality violations with moderate transmission and detection efficiencies. In this paper we propose an experimental setup realizing a simple atom-photon entangled state that, under realistic experimental parameters available to date, achieves a significant violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality. Most importantly, the violation remains when considering typical detection efficiencies and losses due to required propagation distances.}

Here we show that the situation changes dramatically when considering anti-homomorphisms, i.e., f(UV)=f(V)f(U). In particular, we prove that when f is an anti-homomorphism, sequential circuits could exponentially outperform parallel ones and processes with indefinite causal order could outperform sequential ones. We presented explicit constructions on how to obtain such advantages for the unitary inversion task f(U)=U−1 and the unitary transposition task f(U)=UT. We also stablish a one-to-one connection between the problem of unitary estimation and parallel unitary transposition, allowing one to easily translate results from one field to the other.

This description, however, does not directly define its action on non-unitary operations. The action of quantum switch on non-unitary operations is then chosen to be a "natural" extension of its action on unitary operation. Since, in general, the action of a process on non-unitary operations is not uniquely determined by its action on only unitary operations, in principle, there could be a set of inequivalent extensions of quantum switch for non-unitary operations. In this paper, we prove that there is a unique way to extend the actions of quantum switch to non-unitary operations. In other words, contrary to the general case, the action of quantum switch on non-unitary operations is completely determined by its action on unitary operations. We also discuss the general problem of when the complete description of a quantum process is uniquely determined by its action on unitary operations and identify a set of single-slot processes which are completely defined by their action on unitary operations.}

More specifically, we first define the steerability-breaking channel, which is conceptually similar to the entanglement and nonlocality-breaking channels and prove that it is identical to the incompatibility-breaking channel. Similar to the hierarchy relations of the temporal and spatial quantum correlations, the hierarchy of non-breaking channels is discussed. We then introduce the concept of the channels which break temporal correlations, explain how they are related to the standard breaking channels, and prove the following results: (1) A certain measure of temporal nonseparability can be used to quantify a non-entanglement-breaking channel in the sense that the measure is a memory monotone under the framework of the resource theory of the quantum memory. (2) A non-steerability-breaking channel can be certified with channel steering because the steerability-breaking channel is equivalent to the incompatibility-breaking channel. (3) The temporal steerability and non-macrorealism can, respectively, distinguish the steerability-breaking and the nonlocality-breaking unital channel from their corresponding non-breaking channels. Finally, a two-dimensional depolarizing channel is experimentally implemented as a proof-of-principle example to compare the temporal quantum correlations with non-breaking channels.}

In this work we strengthen these results and explore new aspects of this phenomenon. First, we prove new results related to the activation of Bell nonlocality. We construct Bell inequalities tailored to the broadcast scenario, and show how broadcasting can lead to even stronger notions of Bell nonlocality activation. In particular, we exploit these ideas to show that bipartite states admitting a local hidden-variable model for general measurements can lead to genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations. We then study device-independent entanglement certification in the broadcast scenario, and show through semidefinite programming techniques that device-independent entanglement certification is possible for the two-qubit Werner state in essentially the entire range of entanglement. Finally, we extend the concept of EPR steering to the broadcast scenario, and present novel examples of activation of the two-qubit isotropic state. Our results pave the way for broadcast-based device-dependent and semi-device-independent protocols.}
